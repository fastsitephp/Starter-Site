# 🌟 FastSitePHP Starter Site

**Thanks for visiting!** 🌠👍

**This is the main Starter Site for FastSitePHP.** It includes several examples pages and provides a basic directory/file structure. The site is designed to provide structure for basic content (JavaScript, CSS, etc) while remaining small in size so that it is easy to remove files you don’t need and customize it for your site.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Getting started with PHP and FastSitePHP is extremely easy.** If you do not have PHP installed then see instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux on the getting started page:

<a href="https://www.fastsitephp.com/en/getting-started" target="_blank">https://www.fastsitephp.com/en/getting-started</a>

The starter site does not include the Framework so you will need to run [scripts/install.php] to download it and install it. Once setup you can launch a site from the command-line as show below or if you use a Code Editor or IDE [Visual Studio Code, GitHub Atom, etc] then you can launch the site directly from your editor. See the above getting started page for more.

~~~
cd {starter-site-root}
php ./scripts/install.php
php -S localhost:3000
~~~
